# Task Manager

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with Docker

This project supports instant onboarding with Docker Compose. **No manual database setup required!**

### 1. Build and Start Everything

Normally, start with this command:

```sh
docker-compose -p task-manager up -d --build
```

- This will start both the PostgreSQL database (with UTC timezone) and the NestJS app.
- The app will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Note: If you run the project for the first time, please check out the MIGRATIONS file for generating DB instruction.

### 2. Stopping the Project

Run:

```sh
docker-compose -p task-manager stop app
```

---

## Manual Development (Advanced)

If you want to run the app without Docker, you must:
- Have PostgreSQL running on port 54328 with a `task_manager` database, user `root`, password `secret`, and timezone set to UTC.
- Then run:

```sh
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

---
